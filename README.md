Abstract 
---------
We consider the relationship between representations of natural images in a temporally smooth sequence 
(i.e.consecutive frames in a video). Traditionally, sparse coding methods learn representations of images in isolation. 
Here, we learn an image’s sparse representation with the previous image’srepresentation as a starting point.
